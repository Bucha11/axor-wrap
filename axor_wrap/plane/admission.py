"""PlaneAdmission — drives an IntentLoop from a PlaneSession's posture.

Implements the AdmissionController contract over a :class:`PlaneSession` whose
state is updated out-of-band by the plane client's SSE subscription. Pausing
holds here (the node has already finished its current intent — the boundary is
between intents); stopping returns False so the loop winds down like a
cancellation. A disconnected plane never blocks: the session simply stays in
its last posture, and with no pause/stop set the node runs under local config.
